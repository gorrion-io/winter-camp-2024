## Project description

A space team is getting ready for a long trip to Mars. The job was to make a list of team members with specific details:

```ts
type CrewMember = {
  fullName: string;
  nationality: string;
  age: number;
  profession: string;
};
```

The cosmic criteria dictated that only individuals aged between 30 and 40 could embark on the Martian expedition. Additionally, a cosmic endpoint had to be fashioned, presenting an alphabetically sorted list of crew members, equipped with built-in pagination (taking a 'page' parameter). To culminate this cosmic coding voyage, these cosmic travelers were to be displayed within a component, complete with the ability to seamlessly navigate between pages.

## Crafting a cosmic code journey

I spruced up the visuals using `Tailwind` and `MaterialUI`, giving the project a touch of cosmic flair.

To handle YAML files, I enlisted the help of `yaml-js`, making the data manipulation feel like a cosmic breeze.

For checking the pagination, I kept it simple with the `jest` library, ensuring our cosmic journey through pages is smooth and trouble-free.
